library information, see the [top-level README.md](../README.md).

# Module `@jitl/notion-api`

Module `@jitl/notion-api` provides extensions and helpers for the official
Notion public API.

This library uses `@notionhq/client` as a peer dependency for both types and
to re-use the official client.

The library is broadly separated into distinct feature sets:

- A set of helpers for working with the Notion API. This includes
  common types derived from the API's response types, and some iteration helpers
  for fetching content. See the file [notion-api.ts](../src/lib/notion-api.ts)
  for details.

- A content management system supporting functions for downloading and
  caching content from a Notion database. The high-level interface for these
  features is the [[CMS]] class in the file
  [content-management-system.ts](../src/lib/content-management-system.ts), but
  related lower-level tools for working with Notion assets are also exported.
